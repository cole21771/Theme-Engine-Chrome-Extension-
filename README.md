# Theme-Engine-Chrome-Extension-
An Open Source Chrome extension that will allow you to activate different themes for websites. 

# Selling Point
If you have two monitors and like to program in the dark then you'll know the pain of having a dark theme'd IDE on one screen and a pure white internet on the other. Trust me, I speak from experience that this is what true pain feels like. 

# Origin
The original idea for the extension was just to have this one dark theme but soon I realized while showing off my work to others that not everybody wanted this exact dark theme. Some people wanted pitch black background with vibrant text, others wanted different shades of the dark gray. This made me realize instead of only having one theme available, I should allow for others to create their own themes in css and eventually work towards creating a theme created which is where the name comes in: Theme Engine (I might have a better name for the future as not to confuse it with Cyanogen Mod's theme engine for Android).

# How to contribute
Honestly this project is super small right now so I'm not quite sure if it would be feasable for others to contribute, but if you would like to help me personally develope the extension, just contact me somehow (not sure if github has a way to contact others...).
